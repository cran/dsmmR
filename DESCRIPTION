Description: Performs parametric and non-parametric estimation and simulation of 
    drifting semi-Markov processes. The definition of parametric and non-parametric
    model specifications is also possible. Furthermore, three different types of
    drifting semi-Markov models are considered. These models differ in the number
    of transition matrices and sojourn time distributions used for the computation
    of a number of semi-Markov kernels, which in turn characterize the drifting 
    semi-Markov kernel. For the parametric model estimation and specification, 
    several discrete distributions are considered for the sojourn times: Uniform,
    Poisson, Geometric, Discrete Weibull and Negative Binomial. The non-parametric
    model specification makes no assumptions about the shape of the sojourn time
    distributions. Semi-Markov models are described in:
    Barbu, V.S., Limnios, N. (2008) <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-73173-5>.
    Drifting Markov models are described in:
    Vergne, N. (2008) <doi:10.2202/1544-6115.1326>.
    Reliability indicators of Drifting Markov models are described in:
    Barbu, V. S., Vergne, N. (2019) <doi:10.1007/s11009-018-9682-8>.
